### Email Spam Detector - Machine Learning Model (Dockerized)

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Spam Detector** that classifies messages as spam or not spam using a trained **Naive Bayes model**. The model is built using **scikit-learn** and is packaged inside a **Docker container** for easy deployment and usage.

#### Features
* Trains a **Naive Bayes** model using a labeled dataset of SMS messages.
* Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to transform text into numerical features.
* Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future predictions.
* Provides a **Dockerized environment** for easy execution.
* Allows spam detection for new messages via a command-line interface.

#### Dataset
The model is trained on a publicly available **SMS spam dataset**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pycon-2016-tutorial/master/data/sms.tsv`

### Setup & Installation

To get started, you'll first need to clone the repository. Then, you can choose to run the project using Docker or locally with Python.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:sempedia/email_spam_detector.git
### Running with Docker
Ensure you have **Docker** installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
```sh
docker build -t spam-detection .
```

2. **Run the Model Training Script:**
```sh
docker run --rm spam-detection
```

3. **Run a Prediction on a Sample Message:**
```sh
docker run --rm spam-detection python predict.py "Win a free iPhone now!"
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
The `email_spam_detector.py` script downloads the dataset, trains the model, and saves it for future use.

To manually run it (without Docker):
```sh
python email_spam_detector.py
```

### Predicting Spam
The `predict.py` script loads the trained model and classifies a given message as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

Example usage:
```sh
python predict.py "Congratulations! You've won a free vacation!"
```

### Dependencies
This project requires:

* Python 3.9+

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* joblib
* scipy
* numpy

* The requirements.txt file is included in the project structure for easy installation.
If running locally, install dependencies using:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
